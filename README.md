Option Chosen

Option #2: Create a mobile web app that allows you create, edit, and view short notes. Notes are just small textual items, like to-do lists.
- Notes are stored using browser local storage
- The app should be usable on a standard mobile browser

Overview

This is a simple to-do app in AngularJS and BootStrap.
There are three files in total: index.html, controller.js, and css.css. You can view index.html in a standard mobile browser to run this application.
You need to have internet access to run this application, since libraries used are not included locally.
